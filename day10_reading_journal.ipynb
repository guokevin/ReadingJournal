    "### Object-Oriented Features\n",
    "- In Object-Oriented programming, Programs are made of object and function definitions\n",
    "- Objects are supposed to be models of concepts or things\n",
    "- Methods are defined in class definitions to make the relationship explicit\n",
    "- Syntax for calling and invoking a function is different\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing Objects\n",
    "- '%.2d' (Time.hour) can be used to print hour\n",
    "- the object the method is being invoked on is called the subject\n",
    "- When writing method inside of object definition, it is better to refer to the object as \"self\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another Example\n",
    "- When self is an argument, it assumes the subject is self when the method is invoked\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more complicated example\n",
    "- When invoking a method that takes in self and another object, the other object goes into the input argument\n",
    "\n",
    "### The init method\n",
    "- def \\__init\\__(self, hour = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \\__str\\__ method\n",
    "- Returns string representtion of object\n",
    "- def \\__str\\__(self):\n",
    "    return self.hour\n",
    " \n",
    "### Operator Overloading\n",
    "- Python can accept \\__(Whatever operator you want)\\__ as a substitute for that.\n",
    "- i.e. \\__add\\__ can be a function for +\n",
    "- Changing the behavior of an operator is called operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type-based dispatch\n",
    "- isinstance function checks if a value is an instance of the class (value, class object)\n",
    "- special method \\__radd\\__ adds things right to left?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- Functions that work with multiple types are polymorphic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "- def print_attributes(obj)<br>\n",
    "    for attr in obj.\\__dict\\__:<br>\n",
    "    print attr, getattr(obj, attr)\n",
